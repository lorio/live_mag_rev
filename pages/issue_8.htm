              Four Poems by Chris Toll</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Bad File Handle</p>
            <p><br>
              An old crow gossips<br>
              on top of the sign<br>
              for a used car lot.<br>
              Why is a tic in didactic?<br>
              I&#8217;m a sentient bag of gas<br>
              in a crystalline city<br>
              that rides the winds of a planet<br>
              orbiting the primary star<br>
              of a triple star system,<br>
              and I&#8217;m woebegone.<br>
              Why is a loss in colossal?<br>
              The scars will shine for a long long time.<br>
              O Broken Broken Broken Heart,<br>
              one loves more and one loves less.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Why Is Try in Poetry?</p>
            <p><br>
              My usual audience<br>
              is three alcoholic transvestites.<br>
              My metaphors are mixed up.<br>
              You can see<br>
              as well with the heart<br>
              as with the eyes.<br>
              The rowhouses<br>
              stand like mismatched volumes<br>
              in an encyclopedia of grief.<br>
              Why is love backwards in evolve?<br>
              A detective grips her raygun tighter<br>
              and kicks a door open.<br>
              Raindrops are calling to the last in love.<br>
              Them tears are a school that consoles.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>

              <strong>All Is Suffering</strong></p>
            <p><br>
              The smell of gunfire<br>
              fills the Bible.<br>
              Why is less in a blessing?<br>
              An unhappy wife<br>
              rams a forklift<br>
              into the doors of a shopping mall.<br>
              Why is a Bib in Bible<br>
              and what will I be fed?<br>
              In the basement of a convent,<br>
              a CIA-trained mountain lion<br>
              guards a storeroom that contains bazookas<br>
              from an alternate timeline<br>
              where a massive asteroid didn&#8217;t smash into Earth<br>
              and dinosaurs became intelligent.<br>
              Why is harm in a harmonica?<br>
              Elizabeth straps on a bulletproof vest.</p>
            <p><br>
              Server Is Too Busy<br>
              (Bob Dylan Plays Heath Ledger in Heaven)</p>
            <p><br>
              I&#8217;m a digital pilgrim.<br>
              My wren and me<br>
              we&#8217;ve dined for years<br>
              on just one crumb of bread.<br>
              Why is mire in admire?<br>
              The chained chairs groan,<br>
              buds explode on branches,<br>
              and the sun is singing.<br>
              Why is a lion in nonillion?<br>
              Once the Eternal Teenager Gland is activated,<br>
              there&#8217;s no turning back.<br>
              Why is weep in sweep?<br>
              The Bad Joker<br>
              cards his ward of summer lips.<br>
              My Melancholy Rapture drives a car in the rain<br>
              and my Inconstant Castle sneaks into a movie theatre.</p>

            <p>1:45 AM small apartment Feb 13th 2009<br>
              meaningless accord celebrated today<br>
              made it simple again and that&#8217;s enough<br>
              to keep it going to the next year non-pragmatic<br>
              as a scene set with a bird feeder scattered seeds<br>
              putting my shirt back on at dawn disks stacked<br>
              a girl brushing her brown hair with oak frame<br>
              there&#8217;s no guilt in me in her mouth or tone hourglass<br>
              I can think of it till I die then you can have it back<br>
              like random comedy played to perfection we all laugh<br>
              it&#8217;s funny to hear the dog bark see a child draw or doodle<br>
              an image of themselves older married mortgaged<br>
              clownshoes in general around the office at my desk<br>
              stacks of papers I need to look over need to rewrite</p>

            <p><strong>October first.<a name="schnabel"></a></strong></p>
            <p>Banging panes of glass. Sharp windows exceeding the rest of time. 
              <br>
              Completing the disaster of a tin house. <br>
              Echoing to Georgia and back again, <br>
              theses dens master bate my mind leaving one <br>
              with false impressions of time and sturdiness.<br>
              When I was a child everything was built well.<br>
              Nothing got flooded. everything was dry and warm <br>
              and even invited you to come <br>
              stay here.it whispered something<br>
              about staying here. there were no drafts.<br>
              or leeks or disrupted money orders. <br>
              I wouldn't want to be alone in beachwood.<br>
              not sleeping to the wave-like flick of <br>
              the rain. Smacking me every time I regained composure.<br>
              When someone is traumatized the tremor keeps coming back (to visit) 
              you.<br>
              I mean deep trauma. <br>
              You know, like torture or being kept against ones own will. <br>
              So when you wake up in a hot stinking flooded storm in china town. 
              Stench stretching from one rotting Chinese to the bowels of the 
              Atlantic, <br>
              Turn over and ask your man to give a scratch.</p>

            <p></p>
            <p> 1946</p>
            <p>It was while recovering from whooping cough<br>
              that I encountered the Bible<br>
              in the form of the thickest comic book,<br>
              at 128 pages, I had ever seen. <br>
              In one dramatic tale a pink river<br>
              took up an entire frame; frogs filled another<br>
              and the black of night yet another. The turbulent affairs<br>
              of a place called Eggy-put were on center stage, <br>
              including people in robes who were unhappy there;<br>
              and when I asked my mother where Eggy-put was<br>
              she said it was Egypt, the country was Egypt.<br>
              But there is an Eggy-put too, I insisted,<br>
              unwilling to abandon the fruits of phonetic deduction<br>
              as the d&eacute;nouement of the Exodus was put on hold.<br>
              <br>
              1945</p>
            <p>Barely able to read, I must have been; sitting outside on a bench<br>
              perusing one of the adventures of Captain Marvel, <br>
              in the last box of which an evil worm<br>
              with a human head, bald and wearing impenetrable glasses<br>
              was barely escaping the literal clutches of the superhero<br>
              by fleeing wormlike down a tunnel <br>
              toward the center of the earth, vowing to return. <br>
              It was not the threat of mischief from this malefic being<br>
              that gave me pause, or the fact that I didn&#8217;t know all the 
              words,<br>
              but the cut-away section of the passageway to nowhere <br>
              that gave me an unsettling sense of infinity; and I watched <br>
              the passing traffic on Queens Boulevard for a moment<br>
              and then went upstairs and back to my childhood.</p>
            <p>1944</p>
            <p>At four years and ten months, I &#8220;had my tonsils out&#8221;<br>
              at the hospital in Jackson Heights, where,<br>
              recuperating in a crib-like bed, I was addressed<br>
              by my neighbor from the crib-like bed next door.<br>
              She asked my age, and pounced on the fact<br>
              that &#8220;five&#8221; was an exaggeration.<br>
              &#8220;I&#8217;m six,&#8221; she announced triumphantly.<br>
              Did I know how to read? No? &#8220;Well I can,&#8221;<br>
              she revealed with delight, and presumably proved it<br>
              by recounting aloud the doings in her comic book, thus<br>
              completing the mortification of her captive audience &#8212;<br>
              but why do I speak of this terrible woman?</p>

            <p>New infections, novelty diseases<br>
              keep science and the population busy<br>
              communication is not so much the point of living<br>
              but the cause of death, and as we insist <br>
              on its absolute value<br>
              we necessarily understand <br>
              that tragedy&#8217;s a comedy for fools<br>
              who feel more than they think<br>
              emoting all day in a slough <br>
              of anxious dread and<br>
              obtuse jubilation, <br>
              like water and powdered cement<br>
              that refuse to coagulate. <br>
              We drink the tapwater like<br>
              Socrates quaffing hemlock, <br>
              inflate worries into zeppelins<br>
              then spin with no provocation <br>

              spasms of laughter, <br>
              amplified by every passing absurdity.<br>
              Going down with the ship <br>

            <p><strong>IN PRAISE OF BIG MEN<a name="field"></a></strong></p>
            <p> for Gerry Locklin</p>
            <p>I like big gentle guys like him, with big hands,<br>
              a no-bullshit, ugly but irresistible mug,<br>
              sexy like firefighters and policemen are sexy,<br>
              and with a trademark irony that, in a charming way,<br>
              is boyishly self-deprecating too,<br>
              and makes his poems unique.</p>
            <p>He&#8217;s a lot bigger than me, an athlete,<br>
              with hands that could crush beer cans or a wimpy hand like mine.<br>
              I always say he&#8217;d be the perfect big brother &#8211;<br>
              anybody jump me, call me faggot or jewboy,<br>
              and Gerry would be there, saying Sez who?<br>
              He&#8217;s tough, but a softy,<br>
              the most attractive combination in a man.<br>
              Funny, me in that macho Long Beach world.<br>
              but I&#8217;m no threat &#8211; Gerry&#8217;s not afraid of other 
              men,<br>
              he&#8217;s not scared of the varieties of male sexuality.<br>
              He knows where his goes, so mine doesn&#8217;t faze him.<br>
              It was like in the army &#8211; what a relief<br>
              the guys didn&#8217;t beat me up like back home!</p>
            <p>When I first met him &#8211; he and Chuck Stetler<br>
              had written about my first book &#8211;<br>
              they were downing beers like mother&#8217;s milk,</p>
            <p>and amazed I didn&#8217;t join them.<br>
              But I preferred my normal head back then &#8211;<br>
              I wanted to be clearer than normal,<br>
              though with age I&#8217;ve discovered that a drink<br>
              gives a fuzzy glow that blocks<br>
              thoughts of impending doom &#8211;<br>
              one drink. Two wrecks it. <br>
              I also get there with one toke.</p>
            <p>Come to think of it, now that smoke has blown me slightly gaga,<br>
              Gerry&#8217;s like a big puppy, and irresistible.<br>
              Thank you, Gerry, for your true heart &#8211;<br>
              I think that, partly, you like my poems<br>
              out of protectiveness &#8211; that&#8217;s why<br>
              you write so well about children.<br>
              Lucky to have a father that doesn&#8217;t take the strap to you.<br>
              Yours is the poetic voice of the common man at his noblest &#8211;<br>
              too smart for most &#8220;common men,&#8221; of course.<br>
              I sing your praises great and small,<br>
              for the long poems and the short,<br>
              for your friendship and support<br>
              and for the big hands and the big open heart.</p>

            <p>&#8230; compiling: compelling &#8230;<br>
              when the grid flows &#8230;<br>
              when a single hair from the paintbrush loosens itself into mischief 
              &#8230;<br>
              Artemis winks &#8230;<br>
              the clouds over New Orleans liquidating into a painted lake of polyethylene 
              tourmaline &#8230;<br>
              on your feet, Louboutins of silver leather, jade buckles, prose 
              poems, velvet tassels &#8230;<br>
              face powder crumbling into scars of tan flesh &#8230;<br>
              a cat&#8217;s eye warmed by encroaching glaucoma &#8230;<br>
              necklace of skull beads carved from a single skull &#8230;<br>
              Yes: you are lonely &#8230;</p>
