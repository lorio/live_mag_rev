              The birds cry so loudly I wonder if it&#8217;s quieter in<br>
              Brooklyn. He loves the honking trucks and children&#8217;s<br>
              vulgar shouting beneath our window there&#8212;it reminds<br>

            <p>Force eventually melts a man when carried to its limit<br>
              but the nonviolent ones whom some call dreamers<br>
              with a sneer, cling tenaciously to their way and grow<br>
              toughest of all with time.<br>
              Having tried force and failed in my own ways<br>
              I&#8217;m an example of someone convinced of nonviolence.<br>
              All I know is when one of two people doesn&#8217;t want to fight<br>
              the fighting stops. It&#8217;s a wisdom that always comes<br>
              too late. And it never seems to find<br>
              a place of application in regard to national wars<br>
              but I keep it anyway<br>
              in my back pocket and make it talk to me<br>
              walking home alone late at night<br>
              fires climbing<br>

              at his farm, fields corn silk gold. From<br>
              within his mossy gaze, a scorpion struck<br>
              me. I lacked an antidote. Larry clung to Beth&#8217;s<br>
              anecdote of why her mom quit coke.<br>
              &#8220;Mom liked it too much,<br>
              it scared her. She knew it would ruin her life.&#8221;<br>
              Crouched in tall stalks of young corn,<br>
              us, teenage girls, paralyzed within<br>
              his mossy gaze, a scorpion struck. He<br>
              told me I could move the clouds by<br>
              opening my energy. I conjured<br>
              a sun shower. I think I liked<br>
              it too much. In that moment of belief,<br>
              the words china white were never dreamt.<br>
              I think he liked it too much.<br>
              Last I saw, his arms<br>
              looked like a scorpion struck<br>
              him repeatedly. I lacked an antidote.</p>

            <p>No, it's a dragonfly --<br>
              dead, wings strewn with dust.</p>

              Note: There is no word &quot;roist.&quot;</p>

            <p>I sit on the floor on my pillow,<br>
              In the cross-legged position<br>
              Focused on the wall five feet in<br>
              Front of me. I move my foot<br>
              And my concentration breaks,<br>
              Like an old dream,<br>
              I remember, I&#8217;m fucking a girlfriend<br>
              While she speaks in tongues;<br>
              The hair on my neck stands<br>
              Up because I&#8217;m afraid of the<br>
              Long, undecipherable words<br>
              Rushing out of her mouth.<br>
              Then we cum and it&#8217;s quiet;<br>
              She tells me we&#8217;re now married<br>
              In God&#8217;s eyes. You need me.&#8221;<br>
              &#8220;What would I need you for?&#8221;<br>
              I say. &#8220;Fucking,&#8221; she said.</p>

            <p>Night streaks the sky<br>
              like donuts scorched<br>
              onto pavement. Rubber<br>
              screeches. Tires smoke.<br>
              The intention<br>
              to smoke--<br>
              will you?<br>
              A camel carries<br>
              two deserts in its eyes.<br>
              Oh well. He sees<br>
              nothing. He wants<br>
              water. He wants<br>
              what he dare not<br>
              ask. A desert sans sand.</p>

            <p>How long I have been wetting this stone<br>
              with the spit and sweat of my body.<br>
              It is smooth, very smooth, to be so hard.</p>
            <p>Or maybe not,<br>
              maybe only what is hard<br>
              inside <br>
              can have such a smooth surface.<br>
              Maybe my love of what is<br>
              rough, ragged<br>
              and torn is a love for the part that did not turn<br>
              to stone<br>
              on the day I looked back<br>
              and saw the world I knew<br>
              burning to ash<br>
              and smoke dissolving in air.</p>
            <p>What I lost that day, what I left behind&#8212;<br>
              the stone I carry under my tongue.</p>
            <p>I take it out of my mouth and rub it<br>
              whenever I need fare through this world<br>
              the dead call the living.</p>
