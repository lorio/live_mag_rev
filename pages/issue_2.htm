            <p>We grew out of poetry into</p>
            <p>reason, and now poetry</p>
            <p>is the backlash against</p>

            <p>by making automatic</p>

            <a name="reed"></a> <hr> <p>Ms Goose</p>
            <p> The name of the Goose</p>
            <p> Maestro, please.<br>
              Violins, a hint of flute. The springtime of life. Blare! The trumpets. 
              A child is born, a child laughs. Her hair sways from the top of 
              her head as her Dadda holds her up by one foot, and tickles her.<br>
              &#8220;Who is this goose?&#8221; he asks, &#8220;let us examine 
              this goose.&#8221;<br>
              He swings her over his shoulder, and whirls her through the air 
              onto his other shoulder. She is laughing, saying, &#8220;again, 
              again.&#8221;<br>
              These are the happy days of childhood that few remember. The bubbly 
              joy of dumbness, of life not as obstacle but as lark. The carefree 
              hour when exhaustion is settled by a simple pairing of words, &#8220;Mamma, 
              nurse,&#8221; and joy is postponed only by haphazard slumbers, limbs 
              strewn across hay piles, or tossed bedding, or the loving lap of 
              a parent.<br>
              She was &#8220;Goose, silly goose,&#8221; and if she knew her name, 
              her family, her toys, her home, the woods behind the brook, she 
              knew that she was first and foremost of the land of Goosedom, where 
              silliness was as natural to life as food, as sleep, where all of 
              learning was a laugh, a giggle, and another laugh.<br>
              How wretched, how unfair, that all of us should lose that.<br>
              Flash forward: it is many years later and our girl is desponding, 
              broken hearted. Not because she should be&#8212;that wretch wasn&#8217;t 
              in her league&#8212;but because she is a sensitive, deserving girl, 
              who could not help but chase the gingerbread man. He was amusing, 
              and she couldn&#8217;t resist the button eyes. Trouble, indeed, 
              in the wee hours of the morning, but oh those sugar lips.<br>
              Since then, a dalliance with Jack Sprat. She knew better than to 
              strum heartstrings with the married ones, but Jack was devilishly 
              handsome in an all skin and bones way, with large eyes and hands 
              so big they could encircle her waist&#8212;thumb to thumb, index 
              finger to index finger. <br>
              Of course, her disappointment had not exactly been the one she expected. 
              As it turned out, Jack and his wife were swingers who shared everything. 
              Good enough in some ways, but, alas, confusing in others. Miss Goose, 
              after unraveling the intricacies of their tangled web, was forced 
              to put an end to the whole affair.<br>
              And now?<br>
              Miss Moffet, though reliable-ish when it came to perennials and 
              foreign exchange rates, could hardly be trusted with such a charge 
              as finding a man to with whom to enjoy everlasting bliss. Especially 
              in the sense that Miss Moffet hadn&acirc;&euro;&#8482;t managed 
              a successful rendezvous since her tennis instructor had moved to 
              the Northfork, and was likely to nab any of the more favorable specimens, 
              or, frankly, frighten them away. Nevertheless, Moffet had fixed 
              Goose up with a gander. A prospect by the name of Peter Piper.<br>
              Give Peter his due. He was an organic farmer, and wouldn&#8217;t 
              hurt a fly on his asparagus.</p>

            <p>There was nothing left to say.<br>
              Your mouth was a bucket<br>
              of hurt. Throngs of diphthongs<br>
              stole through your brain<br>
              like thieves in a dark <br>
              abandoned lot where you<br>
              looked for your keys<br>
              metonymically speaking<br>
              And for this a black sheep<br>
              they want to brand you!?<br>
              Greetings, good looking.<br>
              I know where you can park<br>
              your heart and count to three.<br>
              You can be a captive of glee.</p>
