            <p>We are never that far<br>
              from the intimacy<br>
              tapping at the window, poking us<br>
              in the crater that was once a shoulder,<br>

              a signature<br>

              in the passive face</p>
            <p>Close the mouth of the mother<br>
              the ear of the listener<br>
              the sound still hangs in the trees<br>
              blinking on and off like fireflies, a light<br>
              connecting the dots in perfect design.</p>

            <p>I heard a real poet* reading his work yesterday. Shattering. When 
              I looked at it in the book I saw that there were no line breaks. 
              Not broken, shattered.<br>
              The sea captain tried to escape last night, but he was quickly captured 
              by the pirates<br>
              1) off the coast of Somalia<br>
              2) in the Gulf of Aden<br>
              Perfume overcomes the trigger, the trauma, the shattering.<br>
              dream ? Trauma<br>
              der Traum<br>
              As the man said, a little stimulation causes the line to break.<br>
              Wraps around<br>
              A tiny song:<br>
              Man with umbrella in backpack<br>
              So it won&#8217;t rain<br>
              Nothing is reliable&#8212;look, my wrist doesn&#8217;t move, the 
              lines break, are broken, no safety<br>
              here/near (when my cane, its curve resting on the table edge, falls 
              down&#8212;crash&#8212;no one starts, stares. I pick it up<br>
              or will<br>
              )<br>
              Shooting schedule: shots of shots: e.g. 1-second shots of shooting 
              (guns) from familiar or unfamiliar western, adventure, period, dramatic, 
              comedy etc. movies<br>
              In blood we trust<br>
              uncertain ground?coherence of vibration<br>
              travelers&#8217; reports?disruption<br>
              other logics</p>
            <p><br>
              Everything opens up. Pretending to read in order not to talk, moving 
              from thought to thought to thought. The line? What about it?</p>
            <p>Your thoughts were elsewhere.<br>
              Why stop with one?<br>
              Have three.<br>
              (melt away)<br>
              I think I&#8217;ll stop here<br>
              but then go on<br>
              read &#8220;beer and sun&#8221;<br>
              for &#8220;bees and sun&#8221;<br>
              jingle of a bell on a bike<br>
              thumbtack, its shadow on the wall<br>

            <h2><a name="field"></a>IN PRAISE OF BIG MEN</h2>
            <p> <br>
              for Gerry Locklin</p>
            <p>I like big gentle guys like him, with big hands,<br>
              a no-bullshit, ugly but irresistible mug,<br>
              sexy like firefighters and policemen are sexy,<br>
              and with a trademark irony that, in a charming way,<br>
              is boyishly self-deprecating too,<br>
              and makes his poems unique.</p>
            <p> He&#8217;s a lot bigger than me, an athlete,<br>
              with hands that could crush beer cans or a wimpy hand like mine.<br>
              I always say he&#8217;d be the perfect big brother &#8212;<br>
              anybody jump me, call me faggot or jewboy,<br>
              and Gerry would be there, saying Sez who?<br>
              He&#8217;s tough, but a softy,<br>
              the most attractive combination in a man.</p>
            <p>Funny, me in that macho Long Beach world.<br>
              but I&#8217;m no threat &#8212; Gerry&#8217;s not afraid of other 
              men,<br>
              he&#8217;s not scared of the varieties of male sexuality.<br>
              He knows where his goes, so mine doesn&#8217;t faze him.<br>
              It was like in the army &#8212; what a relief<br>
              the guys didn&#8217;t beat me up like back home!<br>
              <br>
              When I first met him &#8212; he and Chuck Stetler<br>
              had written about my first book &#8212;<br>
              they were downing beers like mother&#8217;s milk,<br>
              and amazed I didn&#8217;t join them.<br>
              But I preferred my normal head back then &#8212;<br>
              I wanted to be clearer than normal,<br>
              though with age I&#8217;ve discovered that a drink<br>
              gives a fuzzy glow that blocks<br>
              thoughts of impending doom &#8212;<br>
              one drink. Two wrecks it.<br>
              I also get there with one toke.</p>
            <p> Come to think of it, now that smoke has blown me slightly gaga,<br>
              Gerry&#8217;s like a big puppy, and irresistible.<br>
              Thank you, Gerry, for your true heart &#8212;<br>
              I think that, partly, you like my poems<br>
              out of protectiveness &#8212; that&#8217;s why<br>
              you write so well about children.<br>
              Lucky to have a father that doesn&#8217;t take the strap to you.<br>
              Yours is the poetic voice of the common man at his noblest &#8212;<br>
              too smart for most &#8220;common men,&#8221; of course.</p>
            <p>I sing your praises great and small,<br>
              for the long poems and the short,<br>
              for your friendship and support,<br>
              and for the big hands and the big<br>
              open heart.</p>

              from Fados</p>
            <p>what does the house make on Texas Hold-&#8216;em<br>
              my former friend asked me one evening in what<br>
              used to be more legibly spring; <br>
              nothing, I told him, and some would consider this<br>
              the beauty of the game, but they&#8217;re no gamblers.<br>
              A real gambler is to lose, to throw<br>
              it away like the numerical nonsense it is<br>
              to find the way back to the table again, <br>
              with a stake humbled down <br>
              to the minimum nub<br>
              that builds to a fortune <br>
              the gambler then places on rouge<br>
              knowing noir&#8217;s the inevitable next outcome<br>
              the purpose is never to win, <br>
              but to feel for an hour, a day<br>
              the freedom of losing everything: <br>
              the air smells sweeter<br>
              the world wears a fresh astonished look<br>
              as if it indeed existed in and for itself,<br>
              and for his delectation.<br>
              The man who has just been ruined <br>
              walks a special walk<br>
              as if one leg were partly paralyzed<br>
              he shambles to the exit staircase<br>
              oblivious to the house manager<br>
              extending a flute of complimentary champagne, <br>
              and may collide<br>
              with others descending to the pit <br>
              without knowing it.<br>
              His eyes stay fixed on his collapse:</p>
            <p>his one friend in the casino. <br>
              Outside he hears<br>
              birdsong, the soughing of boughs<br>
              sees what grows from the earth even now.<br>
              What can I do, I have reached the impasse&#8212;<br>
              this impasse is his moment <br>
              of orgasm and freedom.</p>

            <p>The palm trees glisten in the sun. On the steps to the fountain, 
              a young woman with a green computer reaches down and scratches her 
              leg. Insects are attracted to water and flesh. In Baghdad, Tammy 
              says, If I wore jeans and a t-shirt on the street, I'd be killed. 
              A man walks past the fountain, talking to a young woman in a green 
              mini skirt&#8212;&quot;You asked me to knock on the door, so I did.&quot; 
              Abdel-Qader choked his daughter holding his foot on her throat because 
              she spoke to a British soldier on the street. Her mother used to 
              call her Rose. A college girl says to her friend who is reading 
              a book, &quot;I will never survive alone.&quot; An old faded peace 
              sign on a lamppost. A vine climbing half way up the leg, the door. 
              I cross the tracks on my bicycle watching the end of the train disappear. 
              2500 miles from home. And the wind is blowing dust everywhere. I 
              close my eyes for a moment. The dervishes in Basra twirl, their 
              long black hair unwinding. I tie a red bandana over my face and 
              then peddle faster and faster. A man stands on the corner with a 
              blue paper mache&acute; mask bobbing on his head, he's looking south 
              for the dark Tucson souls on parade. Then I'm peddling again straight 
              into the wind.</p>

              The brackish stench of this place<br>
              <br>
              Frays, but each day there are so many<br>
              Burials it&#8217;s hard not to get used to it.<br>
              <br>
              The hours brim &amp; hang &amp; sump. Every<br>
              Morning the heart wrenches back<br>
              <br>
              Into my body. None of us have ever<br>
              Been. I find a soot-covered hummingbird<br>
              <br>
              In my pocket each Thursday. After my<br>
              Hands are charred, &amp; then scraped clean<br>
              <br>
              With a knife, there is no better chalice<br>
              Than my mouth. If I could fly into myself<br>
              <br>
              I&#8217;d wear my cape like a blindfold &amp; mosey<br>
              Into the bloated sunset. When you realize<br>
              <br>
              You are missing something, it wasn&#8217;t me.</p>

              Astoria is Queens&#8217; baby grand.<br>
              The avenues strung across Steinway Street:<br>
              E flat minor licked by a finger&#8217;s dreams<br>
              forever. Ebony keys, which are sunken<br>
              not raised, sustaining all this human music:<br>
              Socratic avenue is thirtieth; <br>
              Broadway is sliced lemon meringue pie; <br>
              Steinway near twenty-fifth: a minaret.<br>
              Once Bennetts, Schwimmers, Mermans, Walkens, Archies<br>
              and Joplins played these eighty-eight acres<br>
              and knew that William Steinway had composed<br>
              a factory outside of which the side<br>
              walks were white notes. And as the dark descends,<br>
              this baby grand: its lid is slowly closing.</p>
