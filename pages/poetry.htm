      <p>O, Beauty&#8212;how good / you&#8217;d look on a horst! /<br>
        If only I could understand / what you are saying /</p>
      <p>[Orchestral Break]</p>
      <p>How&#8217;s this for getting things going / I look at your look /<br>
        The accordion continues on / That&#8217;s it. What do you think //</p>
      <p><br>
        Here at Parakultural Canning</p>
      <p>Tonight&#8217;s big dance is a little less / The band&#8217;s late /<br>
        Everybody please take their seats / I&#8217;ll dance with your girl /</p>
      <p>[Orchestral Break]</p>
      <p>Bling flingalang / Oh these shoes are great /<br>
        Your shoes are great / Our shoes are great //</p>

        You&#8217;re Beautiful It&#8217;s True Tango</p>
      <p>Up North it&#8217;s summer so you&#8217;re here / But here it&#8217;s 
        winter, ha ha /<br>
        Hold me, turn me, curve me, learn me / I&#8217;m all yours eight minutes 
        /</p>
      <p>[Orchestral Break]</p>
      <p>My wife died, she was beautiful / What happens to the mind<br>

        over //</p>

        Second Canto </p>
      <p>Thea von Harbou, author of Mabuse the Gambler<br>
        won on a bet for a twelve-year run<br>
        and gloried in honors awards <br>
        and beautiful lovers<br>
        even during the firebombing of Hamburg<br>
        stayed loyal to her lineage and unfaltering<br>
        in her sense of show business, <br>
        knowing that demonic abandon<br>
        is more important to entertainment <br>
        in a catastrophe<br>
        than its indisputable power <br>
        in periods of calm.<br>
        She never wondered<br>
        when she would lose,<br>
        when she&#8217;d be dealt <br>
        a losing hand<br>
        cleaning rubble from the ruins <br>
        and doing post-sync on operetta<br>
        films can hardly be called folding <br>
        in a timely manner<br>
        but isn&#8217;t the same as betting the house <br>
        on a suicidal spin of the wheel<br>
        we wouldn&#8217;t call her a tricheur, <br>
        nor, compared to many<br>
        less objectionable survivors,<br>
        a big-time loser.<br>
        A reduced personality, perhaps,<br>
        but aren&#8217;t we all?</p>

      <p>Completely dead, looking.<br>
        A<br>
        smokestack in July &#8211; no smoke &#8211; not when it&#8217;s this hot.<br>
        The<br>
        lining of my dress is black and blue. <br>
        The<br>
        woodchip path, the woman smelling lavender. <br>
        There<br>
        are so many bees.<br>
        Always,<br>
        the very same flowers. <br>
        I<br>
        return, the coffee is cold.<br>
        The<br>
        walls are painted pink.<br>
        The<br>
        circle I now occupy is the future I have to face.<br>
        The<br>
        lavender sits very still now that it is picked.<br>
        Ants<br>
        live on these steps I&#8217;m sitting on.<br>
        Inside,<br>
        the wooden chair is covered with carved inscriptions: <br>
        Pull me out<br>
        Stay with me<br>
        I just got here.<br>
        I<br>
        pull out my knife and chip away:<br>
        I<br>
        in feeling such green delightAnd then do.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>I sleep on a bed of clustered stars.<br>
        I lie my head down on the moon,<br>
        close my eyes, and think<br>
        about the elegance of scars.</p>
      <p>I wonder if my own skin will recover.<br>
        There have been attacks, times<br>
        when it was blitzed with bloody cuts, <br>
        burns, and other things leaving it marred.</p>
      <p>Pliable skin splits and leaves a narrative.<br>
        What is in the story is in the body,<br>
        or the memories of the body: that pock,<br>
        that rusty nail, rug burn, rope burn, welts,</p>
      <p>each scar a different chapter. My body,<br>
        inundated with obligations, is a decaying<br>
        temple, is a tenement building,<br>
        is an unfinished book marked by stars.</p>

      The Left Hand of Truth 
      <p></p>
      <p>With the rolling stone acquiring its personal moss <br>
        a mile a minute, it was a simple matter to slip an old gray sock<br>
        on the left hand of truth, and over the right a silken stocking.</p>
      <p>There was no need to build a puppet theater. And, anyway,<br>
        you no longer cared about architecture, </p>
      <p>no matter how dramatic.<br>
        You only lived in it, thoughtlessly, <br>
        though you examined your feelings now and then.</p>
      <p>Thus the battle of the giants and the gods went on and on <br>
        in what we might as well call a theater in the round,</p>
      <p>the daily planet, and if you were rarely in attendance,<br>
        either as puppet master or as member of the audience, well, <br>
        the same could said for the rest of us. The world </p>
      <p>spins away, away and away in larger<br>
        and larger spirals, and if the worlds we invent are worth haunting <br>
        it is only because we know they will never get over us,</p>
      <p>never admit to themselves how ghostly we&#8217;ve become. </p>

      <hr> <p>We Are Trying to Change </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Twenty percent of Iraq is dead or fled<br>
        and the moon over the Pentagon is purple </p>
      <p>with glee. The war mask is on <br>
        &amp; Congress has decided not </p>
      <p>to de-fang it. There are desert valleys<br>
        and polluted streams all across the planet,</p>
      <p>but the flames in Iraq have grown hotter<br>
        than the sparks in an old Albanian kitchen--</p>
      <p>and this is a fire that we have seen <br>
        people we once knew light. So we spend </p>
      <p>five nights each week doing our best <br>
        to extinguish. On nights six and seven,</p>
      <p>we get no rest, but must place our minds<br>
        onto a different set of bedpost spikes.</p>
      <p>A new British study says 1.2 million<br>
        civilians have died, a figure so stunning</p>
      <p>it barely gets reported. Bad knees<br>
        and all, we are walking in the streets</p>
      <p>hoping to help arrest our president. The city's <br>
        police think we are their private comedy club,</p>
      <p>but at least we are rushing the stage<br>
        &amp; trying to change the color of the moon.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>The War is raging <br>
        These corporations <br>
        Make us whores of nations<br>
        It is the force we are facing <br>
        We are on the pavement <br>
        In mental enslavement <br>
        waves sent<br>
        In forms of information<br>
        Liberty is caged in </p>
      <p>The golden fictions <br>
        Of globalism <br>
        old and rich men<br>
        Singular visions <br>
        From popes and pitch-men<br>
        Give hope to ditch men<br>
        Contacting every extraction<br>
        Programming for every reaction</p>
      <p>On the surface <br>
        You can be nervous <br>
        That they privatize profits<br>
        While socializing losses<br>
        That life favors the bosses<br>
        But one cannot stop it<br>
        From president to prophet <br>
        The brain is a large deposit</p>
      <p>Our collective conscious <br>
        Was full of nonsense<br>
        Even before the bomb went off<br>
        Let us cough with synchronicity <br>
        And turn off the light with same electricity</p>
      <p>Take a look through the glass</p>
      <p>Boys are killed <br>
        While oil spills<br>
        We drill and feel<br>
        It is so surreal<br>
        And so real<br>
        Use the power<br>
        You are part of the deal</p>
      <p>There is no soliloquy <br>
        Killing we <br>
        Billions of me go forth <br>
        And feel remorse<br>
        As our generation is dying <br>
        And can&#8217;t read while they bleed <br>
        Force-fed what to see<br>
        From a feed<br>
        Fed force<br>
        Loving hypocrisy and ideology<br>
        We sleep in bed <br>
        While others sleep in need<br>
        Keep killing for our creed<br>
        Or was it greed<br>
        And cannot see through frequencies frequently<br>
        In three generation our seeds will see</p>
      <p>The roots of nations and evil be just greenery</p>
      <p>So as people panic that the planet vanish<br>
        And aliens have landed<br>
        In our country and are stranded<br>
        Act so manic about world- wide famine<br>
        Be so candid about the way we damage<br>
        Uncover and rediscover contradictions and scandals<br>
        Scream at the screens and panels<br>
        Remember we are a member<br>
        Or at least a great pretender</p>
      <p>We pass the same mantle down the family tree<br>
        Light a candle for this world of fantasy<br>
        To be able to the say this is the life you handed she or he<br>
        Or how you handled the vision of your reflection <br>
        When you say &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t me.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Another says in their eye, <br>
        &#8220; It was I.&#8221;</p>

      <p>II<br>
        yesterday michelle called and i wasn&#8217;t thinking about jane or fedoras 
        but masking tape,<br>
        butter knives, &amp; occasionally the nature of experience as a shape 
        of leslie scalapino&#8217;s mind, edible flowers too came into focus at 
        some point in the day&#8217;s decision to arrive at a frosty blue perched 
        between bleached white clouds, then I knew it was you who turned on the 
        light and was the entity in dusk daylight apartment pause that Brooklyn 
        day where I defended desire and ate beets, always nice to see you I think 
        though I don&#8217;t see you, fine too, the slippery horsefly wanting 
        out of this bound world, I plan to start a club called the water dance 
        dreamers &amp; we will drink whiskey and not swim,</p>
      <p>V<br>
        Because we are poor, but not here, not boulder, the radical democrats 
        command the stages as post-midlife huckleberry finns, ok ok, we&#8217;re 
        all friends here, old harry smith owned by his friends, they treat his 
        ghost kindly, who will archive my ghost I don&#8217;t ask, </p>
      <p>VIII<br>
        Oh go back out into the lightening and speak to me!, my old friend from 
        long time ago, your voice some kind of necklace pearl, I could choke myself 
        and die happy, I mean that in a good way, as in heart not gesture, don&#8217;t 
        have my soft clothes here, here where the irreconcilable reared, here 
        where every house &amp; building block I walk past is the place where 
        everybody used to live, somewhere,</p>
      <p>IX<br>
        Alice said we could sleep, Alice didn&#8217;t exactly say that, dreamy 
        she was talking about dreams, and I am watching her, I am watching me 
        too, I want to go to sleep and dream about pines, &#8220;miles&#8221; 
        the dream image said, and someone else, maybe &#8220;chris&#8221; or a 
        name starting with the letter &#8220;f&#8221;, his body shrunken to imitate 
        childhood </p>

      <p>i wore an orange and <br>
        pink paisley cotton shift<br>
        that i'd bought for $7.99 at a walmart in north <br>
        carolina<br>
        because it reminded me of a dress<br>
        my mother had in the early 1960's</p>
      <p>i had on pink suede clogs, open-toed<br>
        but<br>
        when i realized i had to walk down the steps <br>
        instead of <br>
        taking the elevator</p>
      <p>i changed into yellow nikes.</p>

      <p><br>
        She answered the door<br>
        wearing a simple red dress,<br>
        her hair folded into a tight<br>
        spool&#8212;Barack wanted to grip<br>
        the polished rung<br>
        of her mouth, but this was<br>
        their first date, so they hot boxed<br>
        his blue Jetta until the smoke<br>
        was so thick it could be spread<br>
        onto shortcake, and he promised<br>
        her adjectives like interesting<br>
        and audacious, and he rolled<br>
        another jay, not wanting<br>
        to come &#8216;cross no square brother<br>
        at the firm,<br>
        and Michelle liked the way<br>
        his words were pennies flicked<br>
        into a fountain, and finally <br>
        they checked out a Spike Lee joint,<br>
        and after the movie he fit<br>
        his hand into hers all the wayt<br>
        home where he sealed his lips<br>
        to her ear and promised<br>
        an obelisk for her garden.</p>
