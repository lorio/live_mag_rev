            <p>Forgive me if I embarrassed you, pal -- <br>
              did that really come out of my mouth?</p>
            <p>Why can&#8217;t I learn to shut up!<br>
              But it just feels so good thinking about you.</p>
            <p>It must be adolescence again.</p>
            <p>Anyway, it&#8217;s not about you, it&#8217;s about me.<br>
              I&#8217;m falling in love all over the place, these days,</p>
            <p>like with an Indian doctor at the VA,<br>
              when he gave me a look with his guru eyes.</p>
            <p>I&#8217;m also in love with the guys in my jackoff pictures.<br>
              Don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;re not in that category,<br>
              though, naturally, every guy&#8217;s dick is of interest.</p>
            <p>I&#8217;ve fallen for about half of Chinatown, too, lately,<br>
              especially the man in the fish market -- I amuse him.<br>
              And there&#8217;s still a helluva lot more of them.</p>
            <p>So relax, I&#8216;m not hitting on you --<br>
              I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re in the world,<br>
              cozy in your snow-bound cabin in the woods,<br>
              where I know the animals come and eat from your hands --</p>
            <p>which is what I call being in love with someone.</p>

            <p>The world is lonely&#8212;a sum of woman&#8217;s truth sung well<br>
              an elegant severity&#8212;kisses too long remembered.<br>
              Haden&#8217;s bow crosses a corner of bitter and treat, his<br>

              Migrant doctors prepared to maim and murder.<br>
              Were they lonely? Is that why they plotted<br>
              The deaths of strangers--syringes a new twist.<br>
              Nouns collapse a fiction&#8212;jihad, terror, conspiracy.<br>
              Mercy, harmony, the redness of human blood, all human blood<br>
              Removed from the narrative even as the blasted bodies<br>
              Fall onto hot dirt, women loudly keening across<br>
              An atlas of grief from Islamabad to Glasgow<br>
              from Baghdad to Barcelona. When the lame stops weeping<br>

            <p>Stay in one place long enough &amp; everyone begins to look like 
              someone else. On the other hand, some people don&#8217;t need a 
              reason to get out of bed. Absence is like presence, better is worse. 
              You better get up early if you expect to learn everything. He barked 
              like a dog &amp; drank water from a dish. The cows are frozen on 
              a distant hillside. Lights at night beckon, we could be anywhere. 
              I remember when we used to go to the Orchidia Bar, on the corner 
              of 9th Street &amp; 2nd Avenue, after the Wednesday night readings. 
              The 2nd Avenue Deli is now the Chase Manhattan Bank. You better 
              keep your mouth shut if you know what&#8217;s good <br>
              for you. The old growth pines at its own expense. The two people 
              <br>
              kissing on the shade, just a mirage.</p>

              interminably on breathing apparatuses<br>
              these also serve,<br>
              though what they serve<br>
              remains a conundrum:<br>
              the caustic, the greedy, the covetous<br>
              the ones who lack all moral compass<br>
              and think lifeblood and money are the same.<br>
              Perhaps it&#8217;s this:<br>
              without them how could we know better<br>
              even as they kill us, or<br>
              experience humiliation, or<br>
              learn what the condition of 99% of our species<br>
              feels like?<br>
              Or distinguish in such obscuring mist<br>
              the difference between a decent action<br>
              and a foul one?<br>
              If all were full of virtue all the time<br>
              if every person were consistently<br>
              one thing or another<br>
              we might judge them,<br>
              without satisfaction<br>
              despise them,<br>
              without letting go our spite.<br>
              Instead<br>
              the youthful dead,<br>
              the ceaselessly alive<br>
              the rampant vicious<br>
              and the insensible<br>
              provide an ever-fresh array<br>
              of circus highlights.<br>
              Material for slapstick,<br>
              for stand-up, for laughs<br>
              either on ourselves or them<br>
              the quick and the dead<br>
              are often the same<br>
              the slow, still-living<br>
              repair the rents in our braids<br>
              all prove the polarity<br>
              and singleness of all<br>
              all demonstrate the unseen<br>
              strata where connection<br>
              is a matter of up quarks,<br>
              down quarks, and neutrons<br>
              just what they, and we,<br>
              exactly serve has never been explained<br>
              hence never been disproven.</p>

            <p>Taxis and fire trucks racing downtown<br>
              Come to a screeching stop on Second Ave.<br>
              Sirens are wailing, ambulances cry<br>
              While South WTC tower collapses<br>
              Someone is hailing a cab in a pair of squash shoes<br>
              A mermaid eats her tuna, shell-shocked<br>
              Accordion buildings breathe a sight of relief<br>
              Amid chaos of siren and nerve raking alarms<br>
              A new day of terror, other buildings fall<br>
              We also remember the two giant Buddhas<br>
              Falling, blown up by Taliban-vandals.</p>
            <p>Let&#8217;s sit down for meditation on life and death<br>
              Meditation on the empty holes, on the towers<br>
              Beauty crushed, people thrown away<br>
              Billie Holliday&#8217;s &#8220;autumn in NY&#8221;<br>
              You almost can see the golden veins<br>
              In the changing color of New York leafs.</p>

            <p>This is how to say, &#8220;Wake up!&#8221;<br>
              This is how a hurricane locks<br>
              horns with a hungover sky.<br>
              This is how the swan dives.<br>
              This is the way to beg for<br>
              a pardon from the governor.<br>
              This is how the dead dance<br>
              hoping for a second chance.<br>
              This is how the quicksand<br>
              of love punches the clock&#8212;<br>
              how to swallow your crutch<br>
              and hop past the emergency.<br>
              This is how the river&#8217;s mouth<br>
              whispers its secret to eternity.</p>
