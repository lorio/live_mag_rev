    <td> <p>Live Mag! was born to run at the Bowery Poetry Club. It was conceived 
        by Bob Holman and Jeff Wright as a performance / publication dual event 
        created specifically for the Bowery Poetry Club. The live events feature 
        editors of other publications as guests. These guests read their own works, 
        read some favorites and then solicit poems from the audience to read. 
        The works that are read are considered &quot;published&quot; in Live Mag! 
        This gives authors an extra chance to be published. </p>
      <p>Previous editor guests have included Hannah Winarsky, editor of Princeton 
        University Press, William Electric Black of La Mama Etc., Michael Andre 
        of Unmuzzled Ox . Erika Jo Brown, editor of Stretching Panties Magazine, 
        Bob Holman of the Bowery Poetry Press and Gary Parrish of Farfalla Press.</p>
