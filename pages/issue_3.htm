            </p>
            <p><br>
              Ginger wants a coffin<br>
              but not for she herself<br>
              she&#8217;d like to see the people in it<br>
              whom she&#8217;s always wished to be<br>
              laid out with long-stemmed roses<br>
              tucked beneath their chalky lifeless hands<br>
              she'll stay all night beside the corpse<br>
              it's Ginger's Ragtime Band<br>
              <br>
              Ginger&#8217;s been the maitre d&#8217;<br>
              at every funeral home I&#8217;ve gone to<br>
              steering people numbed by grief<br>
              right up to the stiff as if she<br>
              made it herself out of paraffin<br>
              <br>
              Ginger feels like nothing much<br>
              until another lucky fatal illness<br>
              strikes someone she can attach to<br>
              crazy glue of legendary Ginger<br>
              sticks to bodies Velcro Girl<br>
              a Post-It note of heartfelt feelings<br>
              &quot;wish you were dead, it's more appealing&quot;<br>
              like the cat who sucks away<br>
              the baby&#8217;s breath<br>
              Ginger sticks around till death<br>
              she's never had much else to do</p>
            <p> She&#8217;s been the intimate of almost<br>
              everyone she never knew<br>
              the proof is all the stuff she looted</p>
            <p><br>
              as their final breaths they drew<br>
              nothing we&#8217;d call larceny more like<br>
              homage to her survival<br>
              just trinkets and some souvenirs<br>
              &#8220;he wanted me to have this,&#8221;<br>
              Ginger says, and through the years<br>
              i never did see Ginger shed<br>
              a single fucking tear.</p>
            <p>She&#8217;s ushered half the town into<br>
              the nothingness awaiting all<br>
              in documentary films she plays<br>
              the most beloved and devoted<br>
              with every passing she&#8217;s promoted</p>
            <p> But humble creature that she is<br>
              she doesn&#8217;t wait around for biz<br>
              if someone isn&#8217;t feeling well, if<br>
              Ginger hears about it, hell,<br>
              she&#8217;s got them in intensive care<br>
              on respirators in despair<br>
              &#8220;I feel so sad,&#8221; is Ginger&#8217;s mantra<br>
              &#8220;to see them go one minute to the next.<br>
              The saddest part is X Y Z<br>
              never got the recognition they deserved<br>
              exactly just like you and me</p>
            <p>look out for that &#8220;you&#8221; when Ginger<br>
              comes around, that &#8220;me&#8221; don&#8217;t quit and<br>
              if you bond<br>
              with her delusions for one minute<br>
              you won&#8217;t just step in shit, my dear<br>
              you&#8217;ll be up to your eyeballs in it.<br>

            <p>I would like to be her Toodle Boople<br>
              And she could be my Poodle Boople.<br>
              And from that comfort zone,<br>
              Famke and Rebecca Romjin could pretend<br>
              To undress each other,<br>
              Or at least undress each other&#8217;s poodles.<br>
              I&#8217;d like to dye Famke&#8217;s poodle mauve,<br>
              And I know how I&#8217;d do it, too &#8211;<br>
              Kool-Aid.<br>
              It should also be mentioned<br>
              That not only does Famke have a giant ass,<br>
              She also has a very powerful mind<br>
              And a hoo-hoo like Tura Satana&#8217;s<br>
              That snaps into action at the first sign of trouble.<br>
              And speaking of poodles,<br>
              Have you heard about the many children<br>
              Forced out of Eric Estrada&#8217;s cocker spaniel?<br>
              It must&#8217;ve been painful<br>
              Like Famke&#8217;s lasik surgery in British Columbia.</p>

              he did so convulsively like blood<br>

            <p>We shall make this prison a university</p>
            <p>Nelson Mandela</p>
            <p><br>
              Here, sticks are pens and fingers are pencils.<br>
              What&#8217;s useless is useful: black boards are carved <br>
              in thighs of sand. A limestone cove&#8217;s our<br>
              lecture hall. The john&#8217;s an uncovered bucket--<br>
              hoards meals, held then hurled from our stomachs.<br>
              Real millet: a memory, which makes our tongues<br>
              swoon, droop like heavy fish nets. Now we scrounge for <br>
              water once kissed by golden grains. A hunger<br>
              that&#8217;s both the brain and body needing victuals.<br>
              Blisters bloom in our lungs. The sun is<br>
              a sucker punch, a fist lodged in the eye.<br>
              Protocol and feces waylay the guards:<br>
              within the husk of this misfortune lies<br>
              an opportunity, class is in session.</p>
            <p><br>
              Notes: University of Robben Island was an ironic name South African 
              political prisoners gave to a limestone area where they went to 
              the bathroom on the island. But because the white guards could not 
              share a bathroom with black prisoners, the political prisoners used 
              this area to teach the imprisoned subjects: both neutral and political.</p>

            <p>There is the door to the house of<br>
              love, and I walk through it, and there<br>
              you are. You are lying naked on<br>
              your bed, and at first I think you are<br>
              dead, but then you stir, you are just<br>
              asleep. Your naked body looks<br>
              so vulnerable, wet and glowing.<br>
              I decide that I must draw you,<br>
              naked and asleep in your bed,<br>
              when I see your eyes open, and<br>
              you sit up quickly. &#8220;What are you<br>
              doing here?&#8221; you ask me, and I <br>
              want to turn, run, hide. &#8220;I was just<br>
              going to draw you as you lay asleep.<br>
              You looked so beautiful, naked,<br>
              asleep.&#8221; You stare at me angrily,<br>
              reaching for a sheet. &#8220;I think not,&#8221; <br>
              you say, &#8220;no. Please leave. Please<br>
              leave.&#8221; So I do. I leave. I walk<br>
              down this empty corridor, and find<br>
              the doorway into the street. The <br>
              street is empty, dark and long. I<br>
              walk and walk forever along this<br>
              dark and empty street.</p>

              let us reflect on the unspeakable.<br>
              In the face of the unfaceable,<br>
              I beg you to dance. I say<br>
              shake it up. Before that<br>
              we heard the Riviera Playboys.<br>
              How do you call the dumbwaiter?<br>
              I am known of mine, secret<br>
              admirer. Live, flee or die.</p>

            <p>The Ride down he drank anisette, zagging<br>
              His beeper, the black Caddie<br>
              Those ringlets at the back of his skull<br>
              How he looked nude, chopping wood<br>
              The mystery of the van, trashed deep in the woods<br>
              How she had been a drug dealer, coke, he said<br>
              How I said come death as he drove it home on the couch<br>
              After the condoms had run out, time after time<br>
              The rifle propped against the wall<br>
              The man next door who never left his house<br>
              His scruffy dog<br>
              The fact that he looked like a Piero della Francesca<br>
              Was not reason enough<br>
              But try telling me that then<br>
              &#8220;Hey you, stop, you are not fiction&#8221;</p>
